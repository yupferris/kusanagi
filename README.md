# kusanagi
Reverse-engineering the xbox one controller USB protocol and writing a simple driver for OS X.

## status
Currently, the driver doesn't really work at all :) lots to figure out still. See `notes` for more info for now.

## motivation
I know other projects that already do this exist (such as [Xone-OSX](https://github.com/FranticRain/Xone-OSX)), but I'd like to try to do this myself without looking at how these other projects work for personal growth and fun. Why else? :D
