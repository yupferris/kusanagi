Reverse-engineering the xbox one controller USB protocol and writing a simple driver for OS X.

## status
Currently, the driver doesn't really work at all :) lots to figure out still. See `notes` for more info for now.

## motivation
I know other projects that already do this exist (such as [Xone-OSX](https://github.com/FranticRain/Xone-OSX)), but I'd like to try to do this myself without looking at how these other projects work for personal growth and fun. Why else? :D

## controller models
Thus far, I've been doing all my testing against a [PowerA Spectra](http://powera.com/Products/PLATFORM_XBOXONE/CPFA115536-01) only, *NOT* an official xbox one controller, so my findings in `notes` may or may not match output from other devices.
